# What is an AI agent
An AI agent is a software system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take autonomous actions to achieve specific goals, often using a combination of reasoning, planning, and learning. Unlike traditional programs that follow predefined commands, AI agents can handle complex tasks and adapt their behavior based on new information and past experiences without constant human oversight. They are powered by technologies like large language models (LLMs) and can interact with digital or physical environments to perform functions such as solving customer issues, generating code, or optimizing workflows.
