1. Time Series (Graph): The default and most common for showing data trends over time (e.g., CPU usage, response times).
2. Stat / Single Stat: Displays a single, large number (e.g., current temperature, total requests).
3. Gauge / Bar Gauge: Shows a value within a range, often used for status or resource usage (e.g., disk space, load average).
4. Table: Presents data in rows and columns, good for detailed metrics.
5. Logs: Specifically for displaying log data.
6. Heatmap / Histogram: Visualize data distribution and magnitude in 2D or as value distributions.
7. Bar Chart / Pie Chart: Good for categorical data and proportions.
8. Geomap: For geospatial data visualization.
9. Traces / Flame Graph: For observability of distributed systems and performance profiling
